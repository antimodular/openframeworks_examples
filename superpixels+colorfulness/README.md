# Labeling superpixel colorfulness with Openframeworks

This example code takes in a live video image and creates pixel clusters based on the <a href="http://ivrl.epfl.ch/research/superpixels">SLIC Superpixel Segmentation</a>.

I used this ofxAddon <https://github.com/zrispo/ofxSuperpixels> which is a wrapper for <https://github.com/PSMM/SLIC-Superpixels>.

In addition each pixels cluster is evaluated for it's "colorfulness" by implementing part of this code:
